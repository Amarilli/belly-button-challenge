# belly-button-challenge

I use the D3 library to read in `samples.json` from the URL `https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json`.

I created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

I used `sample_values` as the values for the bar chart.

I used `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.

I used `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.

I created a bubble chart that displays each sample.

I used `otu_ids` for the x values.

I used `sample_values` for the y values.

I used `sample_values` for the marker size.

I used `otu_ids` for the marker colors.

I used `otu_labels` for the text values.

I displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

I displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

I updated all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, I created a layout for the dashboard.

I deployed my app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. I submitted the links to my deployment and my GitHub repo. I ensured that your repository has regular commits and a thorough `README.md` file

## Advanced Challenge Assignment (Optional with no extra points earning)
The following task is advanced and therefore optional.

I adapted the Gauge Chart from `https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/Links` to an external site. to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

I modified the example gauge code to account for values ranging from 0 through 9.

I updated the chart whenever a new sample is selected.
